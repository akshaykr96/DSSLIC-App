TRADEMARK:

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner

the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

EXPORT CONTROL:

The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export

any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
734.7(b).
